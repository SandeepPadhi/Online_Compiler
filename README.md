# Online_Compiler

The project is the online compiler .
At present it provides following features:
1)Python
2)Java
3)C
4)C++
5)Live Text chat with other users

Following are the important files you need to bother about:
1.)package.json - Run npm init 
                - This will load all necessary node packages.
                - 
2)Server.js   - This is the node server which contains all the necessary code of the server.
               -This also contains the code which processess , compiles and executes the code sent from the client's coding area to the node server.
               -To run the server type node Server.js in the terminal.
               
3)Other files are HTML files which forms the UI.There are other files which are created in run time.


You can then open your browser and type http://192.168.43.63:5508/ which is by default .You can changes it inside Server.js .


Things to improve in the project:
1)The compiler is not interactive at present i.e it does not accept user input.I am still working on it :)
